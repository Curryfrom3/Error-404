###Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

To ensure that every team member understands all aspects of the project,
we will take a collaborative and transparent approach to our day-to-day work.
We will leverage individual strengths by assigning tasks based on each person's area of expertise. 
This will help ensure that everyone is working on tasks that they are most proficient in, and everyone's skills are being utilized effectively. 
Additionally, we will establish regular team meetings and briefings to discuss progress, challenges, and opportunities for improvement. 
By doing this, we can keep everyone informed, aligned, and motivated towards achieving our project goals. Finally, we will create detailed project documentation,
including design specifications, development plans, and project timelines to provide a clear understanding of the project's progress and the direction we're heading. By fostering an environment of open communication, collaboration,
and transparency we can ensure that every team member is well-informed and well-equipped to contribute to the project's success.

##Conflict Plan

###What will be your group's process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
We will host a vote to handle conflicts in-house, and if it results in a tie, we will flip a coin. If the conflict is greater than that, we will seek out an instructor or TA.

###What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
We will politely and directly ask them to step back, but we do not expect this to be a problem.

We will work within our strengths, allowing each member to contribute what they feel most confident in.

###How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
We will address this during our daily stand-up and work within our strengths to ensure everyone is contributing equally.

If our resolution attempts are unsuccessful, we will invite a neutral 3rd party to help resolve the conflict.
